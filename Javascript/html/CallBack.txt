Call Back Function

addition(1, 2, function(result) { console.log('result is ' + result); });
addition(4, 5, function(result) { console.log('addition of x and y is ' + result); });


var addition = function(x,y,callBack){
	var z = x + y;
	callBack(z);
}

We pass functions as input parameters, those will be triggered as a callback based on certain logic in called function.
